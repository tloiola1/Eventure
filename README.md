# Eventure 
This project consists in find events that best suits users preferences.
Firstly, users need to sing up. After signup, the users will answer a simple and straight forward survey which will be used to display the events the best suits their preferences on a events page.
This is a MVC application where we used MySQL to save users information, then find the user and display their preferences on the browser. We have used controllers to direct users for specific pages, controlling the flow.
Note: if user had already signup in the past, it will go straight to events page since we have all information saved in a MySQL Database.
